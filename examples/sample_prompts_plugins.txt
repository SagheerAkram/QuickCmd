# QuickCMD Plugin Example Prompts

This file contains example prompts that demonstrate plugin behavior for testing and development.

## Git Plugin Prompts

### Safe Operations
- "show git status"
- "create branch feature-login"
- "list all branches"
- "show git log"

### Commit Operations
- "commit all changes"
- "commit all changes with message 'Fix authentication bug'"
- "create backup branch and commit changes"
- "stage all files and commit"

### Branch Operations
- "create branch hotfix-security"
- "switch to branch main"
- "delete branch old-feature"
- "merge branch feature-x into main"

### Backup and Undo
- "create backup branch before making changes"
- "revert last commit"
- "undo last 3 commits"

### High-Risk Operations (require approval)
- "force push to origin main"
- "delete branch production"
- "reset hard to previous commit"

## Kubernetes Plugin Prompts

### Read Operations (Safe)
- "get pods"
- "get pods in namespace production"
- "list all deployments"
- "describe pod nginx-123"
- "describe deployment api"
- "show service endpoints"

### Scale Operations (Require Approval)
- "scale deployment api to 5 replicas"
- "scale deployment frontend to 10"
- "set deployment backend replicas to 3"

### Apply/Create Operations (Require Approval)
- "apply manifest deployment.yaml"
- "apply config from k8s/service.yaml"
- "create deployment from manifest"

### Delete Operations (High Risk)
- "delete pod nginx-123"
- "delete deployment old-api"
- "remove service legacy-backend"

### Namespace Operations
- "get pods in namespace staging"
- "list deployments in namespace production"
- "describe service api in namespace default"

## AWS Plugin Prompts

### Read Operations (Safe, No Cost)
- "list ec2 instances"
- "list s3 buckets"
- "describe cloudformation stack my-stack"
- "show all running instances"
- "list all security groups"

### Low-Cost Operations
- "create s3 bucket my-app-logs"
- "describe instance i-1234567890abcdef0"
- "list all lambda functions"

### Resource Modification (Require Approval)
- "increase asg my-asg to 5"
- "set auto scaling group web-servers to 10"
- "modify asg api-servers desired capacity to 8"

### High-Cost Operations (Require Approval)
- "launch 10 ec2 instances"
- "increase asg production to 50"
- "create rds instance db.m5.large"

### Blocked Operations (Credential Exposure)
- "configure aws access key AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE" (BLOCKED)
- "set secret key wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY" (BLOCKED)

## Combined/Complex Prompts

### Git + Backup
- "create backup branch and commit all changes with message 'Before refactor'"
- "make a safety checkpoint before deleting old files"

### K8s + Namespace
- "scale deployment api to 5 replicas in namespace production"
- "delete pod failing-worker in namespace staging"

### AWS + Cost Awareness
- "increase asg my-asg to 20 instances" (triggers cost warning)
- "create 5 new ec2 instances" (triggers cost approval)

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Ambiguous Prompts
- "scale to 5" (missing deployment name)
- "delete pod" (missing pod name)
- "create bucket" (missing bucket name)

### Invalid Operations
- "delete all pods" (too dangerous, should be blocked)
- "force push to production" (requires strong confirmation)
- "rm -rf /" (blocked by core denylist)

### Non-Plugin Prompts (Fallback to Core)
- "find files larger than 100MB"
- "delete all .DS_Store files"
- "show disk usage"

## Testing Scenarios

### Confidence Scoring
- "commit changes" (high confidence - exact match)
- "save my work" (medium confidence - fuzzy match)
- "do git stuff" (low confidence - vague)

### Risk Classification
- "git status" (safe)
- "scale deployment" (medium)
- "delete pod" (high)
- "force push" (high)

### Approval Requirements
- "create branch" (no approval)
- "delete branch" (approval required)
- "kubectl apply" (approval required)
- "increase asg to 100" (cost approval required)

### Plugin Metadata
- Git: backup branch names, undo strategies
- K8s: RBAC context, namespace info
- AWS: cost estimates, region info

## Performance Testing

### Rapid Fire Prompts
1. "list pods"
2. "get deployments"
3. "show git status"
4. "list s3 buckets"
5. "describe stack"

### Long Prompts
- "create a new git branch called feature-user-authentication-with-oauth2-support and commit all my current changes with a descriptive message about implementing the new login flow"

### Special Characters
- "commit with message 'Fix: handle special chars like $, &, |'"
- "create bucket my-app-logs-2024-01-07"
- "scale deployment api-v2.0 to 5"

## Multi-Language Support (Future)

### Spanish
- "listar pods"
- "escalar deployment a 5 replicas"

### French
- "créer une branche git"
- "lister les buckets s3"

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test a specific prompt
quickcmd "create backup branch and commit changes"

# Test with dry-run
quickcmd "delete pod nginx-123" --dry-run

# Test with sandbox
quickcmd "scale deployment api to 5" --sandbox
```

**Testing Tips:**
1. Start with safe read operations
2. Test approval workflows with medium-risk operations
3. Verify cost thresholds with AWS operations
4. Check undo strategies are generated for destructive ops
5. Confirm plugin metadata appears in audit logs
